# Error Response Syntax (ERS)

Pronounced "Errs" (like "errors")

## Overview

The Error Response Syntax is an attempt to address a lack of
standardized error responses in software development. When designing or
consuming an application, API, or other piece of software, it would be
helpful if there was as commonly-accepted list of attributes and
accepted values for applications to use.
